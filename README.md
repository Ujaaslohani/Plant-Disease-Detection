# Plant-Health-Detection

## 🏡 About The Project

This project aims to classify plant diseases using deep learning with a ResNet50 model pre-trained on ImageNet. The goal is to take images of plant leaves, identify the plant species, and detect the disease the plant is affected with.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- **Data Augmentation and Preprocessing:** Handling missing values and outliers
- **Feature Scaling:** Applying normalization and standardization for improved performance
- **Model Selection:** Testing various algorithms to identify the best-performing model
- **Data Visualization:** Creating insightful visualizations for better understanding
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using various metrics
